# sudoers.d entry to allow telegraf to run specific vcgencmd operations as root
#
# WARNING: Editing /etc/sudoers or copying a file into /etc/sudoers.d is risky
#   and can break sudo for all users on the system. Fixing a broken sudoers
#   file will require using a second pre-existing root shell or editing files
#   on the RPi's SD card using another Linux system to revert the changes.

# More info:

#
# That said, this file works fine on my Debian Buster-based and Ubuntu systems but
#   your mileage may vary depending on your distro and your existing sudoers config.
